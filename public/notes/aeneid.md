### General Thoughts

The Aeneid is a chronological sequel, a structural retelling, and a thematic inversion of The Iliad and The Odyssey. It tells the story of Aeneas, a Trojan prince displaced after the fall of Troy, and his journey to found Rome. The first six books evoke the structure of Odysseus’ journey in The Odyssey. These books follow the same beats as The Odyssey, such as retelling the events of the Trojan War, their various obstacles at sea, and communing with the dead. However, while Odysseus is pushed forward by his love and longing for his family, Penelope and Telemachus, Aeneas is pushed forward by the new theme Virgil hopes to present, piety (duty). Instead of being empowering, love is an obstacle and a temptation for Aeneas, as his duty compels him to abandon his love, Dido, dooming her to suicide, and trudge forward to found Rome.

The next six books evoke the structure of The Iliad, as Aeneas arrives in Italy, and is forced into a conflict with the local kings over a supposed “stolen” marriage. These books also follow the same beats as The Iliad, such as the catalogue of ships, the acquisition of divine arms from Hephaestus/Vulcan, and even the stealth mission of Odyssues and Diomedes. However, where The Iliad ends with Achilles cleansing himself of his rage through empathizing with Priam, the father of Hector, The Aeneid places this beat in chapter ten out of twelve, instead choosing to end the book with the Iliadic equivalent of Achilles killing Hector. This is because the “Achilles” of The Aeneid is not Aeneas, but Juno/Hera. The poem actually starts with “I sing of arms and a man displaced by Fate, … the power of the gods and of the vicious wrath of Juno. The “important thing” that happens in the final chapter of The Aeneid is Juno letting go of her anger at the Trojans, and submitting to the will of Jupiter or Fate, displaying her piety. This inverts the themes of The Iliad, instead of love and empathy being the cure for rage, piety or submission to a higher power is.

### Thoughts on Homeric and Platonic influence

The Homeric influence on The Aeneid is obvious, but it also has very obvious Platonic influences, which is seen especially in chapter six. In the underworld scene of The Odyssey, Odysseus summons the spirits of the dead, but the underworld is not specifically described. In The Aeneid, Aeneas physically goes into a hole in the ground, recalling The myth of Er in Plato's Republic. The afterlife is also described as a reward or punishment for the way a soul lived their life, before reincarnating back into this world.

### Thoughts on the Virgillia underworld

Virgil describes the underworld, taking inspirations from Homer and Plato, but also adding his own ideas. A notable inclusion of people in "hell" are people who amass wealth, showing which valuables were favorable in Roman culture. "Heaven" is also described as free-spirited.

### Thoughts on the genre

The Aeneid is unique in the books I've read so far in the sense that it blends literature, history, and philosophy. Its literary elements stem from its imitation of Homer, it also tells a lot of the history of Rome, including the foundation, the Punic Wars, and the Civil Wars leading to Augustus in the form of prophecy, but from Virgil's perspective it was history. Its description of the afterlife are adding to the philosophical work of Plato as well.

### Thoughts on the theme of class

Virgil includes a few hints of his background from the (relative) lower class of Rome, as he grew up in the countryside. While describing the Latin-Trojan conflict, he laments about the difference in how farmers bury their dead, in a huge pile of flesh and bones, compared to how the highborn bury their dead, with lavish funeral rites. Virgil also laments the injustice that farmers are dragged into this conflict between Aeneas, Turnus (a Latin King), and Lavinus (another Latin King), and how these personal grudges lead to pointless deaths.
