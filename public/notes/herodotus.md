#### General thoughts

Although Herodotus claims to be mostly factual to the best of his ability, there is one conversation in this work that is competely fictional, the conversation between Solon the Athenian and Croesus of Lydia. Solon died before Croesus was born, and this was common knowledge to Herodotus' audience. Thus, there must be a reason why Herodotus included this dialogue. The dialogue essentially boils down to Solon criticizing Croesus for his hubris, explaining that one can only truly be happy when they are dead. Right after this conversation, Croesus loses his son and his entire kingdom to Cyrus of Persia. Each Persian king we follow falls victim to this hubris, Cyrus when he invades the Massagetae, Cambyses when he invades Ethiopia, Darius when he invades Scythia, and finally Xerxes when he invades Greece. This can also be viewed as a general metaphor for the Persian Empire as a whole.

#### Thoughts on the development of the concept of nations

It is shown repeatedly in this work that there is immense discord amongst the various Greek cities, and many pieces of evidence that they do not see each other as one people. In fact, many Greeks sided with the Persians. But through the tone of Herodotus himself, we feel the beginnings of pan-Hellenic identity, which then the conclusion can be reasonably drawn that pan-Hellenic identity began with the Persian invasion.

#### Thoughts on the preference for death over life

Herodotus expresses several times in his work a preference for death over life. The conversation between Solon and Croesus being the chief example. Croesus asks Solon who he thinks is the happiest man he has met. Solon responds with some dead guy, and repeats this for the second and third happiest as well. The point is that life is not over until it is over, and thus happiness is only a fleeting feeling. This can be seen in the eventual collapse of each king of Persia, as well as their ultimate defeat at the hands of the Greeks.
