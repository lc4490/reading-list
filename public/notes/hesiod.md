#### General Thoughts

I picked up this book because I wanted a cosmology to compare with the Origins of the World in the Nag Hammadi scriptures. It does create a pretty complete cosmology of the world, Theogony detailing how the gods and the universe came to be, and Works and Days detailing how man came to be.

#### Thoughts on Theogony

This was not a very entertaining read. I guess it is interesting world-building? It just seemed kind of like the info pages in video games, where its fun to read them sometimes but most people just skip them and play the game.

#### Thoughts on Works and Days

This started similar to Theogony, as Hesiod tells of the creation of man, but it soon devolved into just morality exposition and also farming advice? One interesting thing to note is the similarity between Eve and Pandora, both women created out of earth and water, and used as a pawn by a deity in order to doom mankind.
