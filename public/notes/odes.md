### General Thoughts

The Odes of Horace are a collection of short poems attributed to the poet Horace, tied together by the common themes of the inevitability of death, the fruitlessness of greed, and of the enjoyment of the simple life. Death comes for us all, but life is meant to be enjoyed whilst we have it. The pursuit of money or status is endless, and none of it matters after we die.

### Thoughts on the parallel between Prometheus and Eve

Horace relates the myth of Prometheus bringing down fire for the humans, a traditionally heroic act as seen by the Greeks, as also bringing with it, fever, disease, and death. The fire in this myth symbolizes knowledge and civilization. This parellels with Eve eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, bringing knowledge to humanity, but with it also original sin. To go further, the name Lucifer comes from the two Latin roots: Lux (light) ferre (carry), so Prometheus can also be considered a light carrier when he brought fire to humanity.

### Thoughts on Horace’s perspective on wealth

Horace uses the myth of Zeus impregnating Danae as literal gold to present the idea that gold, above all others, is the most powerful force in the world, but also the most corrupting. Horace relates this to real history, speaking of how Philip of Macedon brought down powerful Greek cities through bribery. Horace also warns against the dangers of wealth acquisition, preferring a humble, simple life. He asserts that all the gold in the world is worth nothing without virtue, and in fact, indulging in excess wealth is contrary to virtue.
