### General Thoughts

An Oresteia tells the story of the cycle of revenge of the royal family of Argos. It begins with Agamemnon’s triumphant return from his victory in the Trojan war. He is immediately slain by his wife Clytemnestra, as revenge for their daughter Iphigenia. On their way to avenge the slight against his brother Menalaus, due to the abduction of his wife, Helen, by Paris Alexander of Troy, the Greek fleet was trapped at sea by strong gusts of wind. On the advice of a fortune teller, Agamemnon decides to sacrifice his beloved daughter Iphigenia, which clears the winds and allows the Greek fleet to sail to Troy. As revenge, Clytemnestra killed Agamemnon as soon as he came home. As revenge for this, Agamemnon and Clytemnestra’s other children, Orestes and Elektra, kill their own mother. Now, the city of Argos calls for revenge against the siblings, holding a vote as to whether or not to stone them. Note that up to this point, the words of revenge and justice could easily be interchanged, which is the point of this story. The story sees how the idea of justice is ultimately corrupting, and the story ends with Orestes and Elektra using justice to justify their kidnapping and threatening of two innocent lives in order to escape judgement from the people of Argos for the murder of their mother.

#### Thoughts on how the three Athenian playwrights represent the rise, peak, and fall of Athenian society

From my limited reading of the Athenian tragedies, I believe that Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides represent three different eras of the story of Athens. Aeschylus depicts the city’s rise: in the Oresteia he dramatizes the necessity of the Athenian legal system, while in The Persians he celebrates the triumph of democracy over monarchy after the Persian Wars. Sophocles represents Athens at its height, exploring the responsibilities of leadership and the dangers of pride through figures like Oedipus and Creon. Euripides, by contrast, exposes Athens’ hubris in its imperial age. In works like The Trojan Women he empathizes with the victims of war, while The Bacchae serves as a warning against reckless arrogance and destructive frenzy. Taken together, the three playwrights map Athens’ trajectory: from the optimism of its ascent, through the glory of its peak, to the disillusionment of its decline.

#### Thoughts on comparison to Aeschylus' original Oresteia

In Aeschylus' original Oresteia, comprised of Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and Eumenides, this cycle of violence serves as a justification for the Athenian judicial system. Eumenides ends with a literal Athenian trial, participated by the gods themselves. This kind of just serves as propaganda, and is not very interesting to me as itself. However, by changing the ending to Euripedes' Orestes, the story ends not with order but with a hollow deus ex machina, underscoring the irony of trying to systemize justice at all. The story is also far more focused on the psychology of the characters. Clytemnestra's psychology is already fully explored in Aeschylus' Agamemnon, her desire for revenge for the death of her daughter. Sophocles' Electra dives further into the psychology of Electra, as opposed to Agamemnon's Libation Bearers which is more plot-focused. Here, Electra serves as a direct mirror to Clytemnestra, as Sophocles uses the same langauge when Electra watches Orestes murder Clytemnestra as Aeschylus used when Clytemnestra murdered Agamemnon. Then, Euripedes' Orestes shows both the depravity of justice, when Electra and Orestes in their desperation turns to kill and threaten Helen and Hermione, two innocent people unrelated to their situation, as well as the corruption of democracy, as the Mycanean crowd are clearly less interested in justice and more interested in who inherits political power.
