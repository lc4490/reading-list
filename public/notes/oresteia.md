#### Justice and its contradictory nature

Tells the story of how the fervor for justice dismantles the house of Atreus. Agamemnon believes himself just in sacrificing Iphigenia for the greater good, Clymenestra believes herself just in killing Agamemnon in revenge, Electra and Orestes believe themselves just in killing Clymenestra in revenge. In their pursuit of justice, Electra and Orestes grow more and more depraved in their pursuits. There is no resolution, except for deus ex machina, a mockery that the concept of justice can somehow be systemized.
