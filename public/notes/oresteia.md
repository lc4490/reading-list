#### General thoughts

Anne Carson did something really unique by taking one play from each Athenian playwright (Aeschylus’ Agamemnon, Sophocles’ Electra, Euripides’ Orestes) and crafting a cohesive story. This story dramatizes the contradictory nature of justice. Each act of violence is presented as just, yet only creates more violence. Agamemnon sacrifices Iphigenia, his daughter, in the name of justice for the common good -> Clytemnestra, Iphigenia's mother, murders Agamemnon in response to the death of her daughter -> Electra and Orestes, children of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, murder Clytemnestra in response to the death of their father. As the cycle continues, Electra and Orestes descend into greater depravity, revealing that the desire for justice is indistinguishable from violence.

#### Thoughts on how the three Athenian playwrights represent the rise, peak, and fall of Athenian society

From my limited reading of the Athenian tragedies, I believe that Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides represent three different eras of the story of Athens. Aeschylus depicts the city’s rise: in the Oresteia he dramatizes the necessity of the Athenian legal system, while in The Persians he celebrates the triumph of democracy over monarchy after the Persian Wars. Sophocles represents Athens at its height, exploring the responsibilities of leadership and the dangers of pride through figures like Oedipus and Creon. Euripides, by contrast, exposes Athens’ hubris in its imperial age. In works like The Trojan Women he empathizes with the victims of war, while The Bacchae serves as a warning against reckless arrogance and destructive frenzy. Taken together, the three playwrights map Athens’ trajectory: from the optimism of its ascent, through the glory of its peak, to the disillusionment of its decline.

#### Thoughts on comparison to Aeschylus' original Oresteia

In Aeschylus' original Oresteia, comprised of Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and Eumenides, this cycle of violence serves as a justification for the Athenian judicial system. Eumenides ends with a literal Athenian trial, participated by the gods themselves. This kind of just serves as propaganda, and is not very interesting to me as itself. However, by changing the ending to Euripedes' Orestes, the story ends not with order but with a hollow deus ex machina, underscoring the irony of trying to systemize justice at all. The story is also far more focused on the psychology of the characters. Clytemnestra's psychology is already fully explored in Aeschylus' Agamemnon, her desire for revenge for the death of her daughter. Sophocles' Electra dives further into the psychology of Electra, as opposed to Agamemnon's Libation Bearers which is more plot-focused. Here, Electra serves as a direct mirror to Clytemnestra, as Sophocles uses the same langauge when Electra watches Orestes murder Clytemnestra as Aeschylus used when Clytemnestra murdered Agamemnon. Then, Euripedes' Orestes shows both the depravity of justice, when Electra and Orestes in their desperation turns to kill and threaten Helen and Hermione, two innocent people unrelated to their situation, as well as the corruption of democracy, as the Mycanean crowd are clearly less interested in justice and more interested in who inherits political power.
