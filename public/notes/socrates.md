#### General Thoughts

This text was my introduction to Greek philosophy. The text is divided into four dialogues: Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, and Phaedo. On their own, they each have their own unique philosophical points, but taken together, they tell the story of the death of Socrates. This text was very challenging to read, because of its density. There are a lot of complex concepts in these relatively short dialogues, so I've really tried to re-read and process this text as slowly as possible.

#### Thoughts on Euthyphro

In this dialogue, Socrates tackles the nature of piety, and examines what it truly means to be pious. Euthyphro is a young citizen who is prosecuting his father for the murder of a day-labourer, after the day-labourer killed one of the family slaves. There is a conflict here within Euthyphro, as he is torn between his duty to his father and his sense of piety, ultimately choosing piety. Socrates does not condemn Euthyphro's action against his father, not questioning the morality of the action itself, but poses the question to Euthyphro: what even is piety? For something that is worth a son prosecuting his own father, Socrates assumes that piety is something that Euthyphro understands very deeply. Upon being questioned, Euthyphro answers that piety is simply what is loved by the gods. Socrates response to this is what I find to be the most interesting point in this dialogue by far: is what is pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods? Euthyphro answers by declaring it is because things are pious that they are loved by the gods, but when pressed as to what is the nature of these things that make them pious, he cannot say. The point of this dialogue is not to answer what things are pious or impious, but to rather challenge our understanding of what piety even is. It serves as a perfect introduction to the nature of philosophy, which is to question our very base beliefs about everything.

#### Thoughts on the Christian response to Euthyphro

In Euthyphro, Socrates presents a problem: if piety is not what is loved by the gods, but it is piety itself that the gods love, what is piety? Plato later attemps to solve this question with the "Theory of Forms", which argues that regardless of human interpretations of piety, there is a perfect form of piety called the "Form of the Good." Christians will later take this concept and make the Christian God the embodiment of the "Form of the Good." If Euthyphro were a Christian, he would simply respond that what is pious IS what God loves, because God is the perfect good/piety/justice. This does raise an interesting counterpoint, which is that the terms, "God is good" or "God is just," boil down to just "God is God". Furthermore, unlike the initial intention of Socrates or Plato, who intended for the "Form of the Good" to be something each individual sought out and discovered through philosophy and dialogue, Christians simply obey the authority of the Bible and God, which is the antithesis to the original intent.

#### Thoughts on Apology

In this dialogue, Socrates defends himself against the accusations levied against him, of corrupting the youth. Socrates claims he has done no such thing, all he does is understand his own lack of wisdom, and confront those who think themselves wise. True knowledge is understanding the limits of one's own knowledge, and having the humility to seek it out and learn. Socrates declares he has no doubt pissed off most of Athens with his actions, as people do not want the challenge of learning, or the humility of accepting what they do not know. People want what is easy, to not have their beliefs challenged. Socrates, however, claims that it is his divine duty to be the annoying gadfly in the ear of a horse, as that is what is best for the soul of the community. Socrates places a lot of emphasis on the soul, and how its cultivation lies in the pursuit of philosophy, the discipline of discovering what is right, and that the neglect of this discipline will lead to a decadence in the soul. Just like the body, if one does not "exercise" the soul, it will grow weak. Socrates further argues that the development of the soul is even more important than the development of the body, or the pursuit of money. Socrates declares that if his life is spared on the condition he can no longer practice his philosophy, he would rather die. This defense is obviously not very effective, and the people vote to kill him.

#### Thoughts on Crito

In this dialogue, Socrates is compelled to escape his imprisonment by his student, Crito. Socrates refuses to escape, claiming that it would be disrespctful to the city of Athens to disobey its laws. Here, Socrates displays a sense of extreme honor, that he truly is willing to die for his principles. He echoes a lot of the sentiments in Apology.

#### Thoughts on Socrates' view of death

Socrates' seemingly willingness to die is twofold. First is his extreme conviction in his mission, but the other is that he does not fear death the way his contemporaries, or even we do.Socrates argues that if the soul does not exist, and that death is just an endless sleep, it would very peaceful. However, if the soul does exist, and Socrates' soul would go to Hades (the common belief at the time), it is far more important for him to die while cultivating his soul, rather than live and letting it rot, only for it to be weaker when he eventually does die.

#### Thoughts on Socrates parallels with Jesus

Through my reading of The Lasy Days of Socrates, I cannot help but notice so many parallels between his life and Jesus Christ. Both Socrates and Jesus were the "son" of a stonemason. Both Socrates and Jesus preached a message salvation by prioritizing cultivation of the soul over material matters. Their teachings lead them into conflict with the established order, Socrates due to his rejection of the Greek pantheon, Jesus due to this rejection of the Roman pantheon as well as the traditional Judaic teachings. For their teachings, they were both executed by a somewhat democratic process by their own people, the people they were trying to save.

#### Thoughts on Phaedo

In this dialogue, Socrates speaks to two of his students, Simmias and Cebes, about how he does not fear death but in fact welcomes it, and explains his justification as to why. Socrates believes his
