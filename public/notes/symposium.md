#### General Thoughts

This was a very short yet highly enjoyable read. The symposium sees six philosophers debate the age-old question: what is love? (baby don't hurt me) I found myself wildly captivated by this debate, despite none of these defintions of love really appealing to me. I found it rewarding enough to just experience and follow thoughtful ideas, even if I didn't agree with them per se. I think that is the intent of the text, as it does present six diverging opinions on love, and it prompts the reader to be the seventh (or eight if you count Alcibiades disruption), to consider and present their own definition of love. Love in this dialogue is actually referred to as "eros", which we in the modern day stupidly denote as just "sexual love". It is clear in this text that the meaning of "eros" far surpasses that definition.

#### Thoughts on Phaedrus

Phaedrus presents the idea that love is the origin of virtue. Because we care about what our partners think of us, it prompts us to be good, to be brave. He proposes the idea of a battalion in which all the soldiers were lovers, and states those soldiers would be the bravest battalion ever seen. He was proven correct by the sacred band of Thebes. This is an interesting conception of love to me, but it feels incomplete. This concept of love would almost prompt lovers to be deceitful towards each other, in order to present the sense of virtue, which I don't think is truly love.

#### Thoughts on Pausanias

Pausanias presents the idea that two loves exist, heavenly and commonly. His evidence for this is that Aphrodite famously has two birth stories, one predating even the Greek pantheon, and one as the daughter of Zeus. He argues that just as there are two Aphrodites, a heavenly one and a more common one, there are also two loves. One in which emphasizes the growth and development of both individuals, and the other which can be equated to our modern definition of lust. Out of all the conceptions of love in this dialogue, I find this the most compellnig, but I don't necessarily agree that there is a distinct sepration of love and lust.

#### Thoughts on Eryximachus

Eryximachus is a doctor, and thus has a very boring conception of love. His opinion is that love is just the natural harmony of the universe, as well as within our bodies. I guess that's a cool belief but it isn't very thought-provoking.

#### Thoughts on Aristophanes

Aristophanes presents the myth that humans were once creatures with eight limbs, two humans fused together. Love is simply the desire to be whole again, to find our other half. I disagree with this conception, as I don't believe in the concept of soulmates. The idea that once you find your perfect person everything just works out until the end of time with no conflict or compromise is something I have not experienced and struggle to imagine. I also think philosophically that wholeness comes externally is quite foolish. Aristophanes' definiton of love would fit our modern term of codependency.

#### Thoughts on Ariston

Ariston's speech is intended to be very beautiful, but lacking in real substance. I found it very dull, but that may be because of the translation, which does not capture the artistry of the original greek. Regardless, he presents a whole lot of nothing about how love is youthful, beautiful, and virtuous with lackluster reasoning. He only exists in the narrative to setup Socrates to dunk on him.

#### Thoughts on Socrates

Socrates presents a weird argument, that love is the desire for immortality. It goes as following: love is the desire for something/someone. If love gets that thing, love will be happy, therefore love wants to be happy. But once love gets that thing, it still desires it, because it wants it in perpetuity. The example here can be a girl has a crush on a guy, so he desires her. She asks out guy girl and they start dating. She doesn't stop desiring him because she has him, but still desires him to be hers for the future. Thus, according to Socrates, love is the desire for happiness in perpetuity, thus love is the desire for immortality. The way human beings achieve immortality is by either raising children or by creating great works of art to be remembered. This conception of love does not appeal to me, it defines love as simply desire.

#### Thoughts on Alcibiades

This dinner party is hit with the wildest plot twist, it is suddenly interrupted by Alcibiades, who stumbles in drunk and gives a eulogy for his love for Socrates. Alcibiades comes off as a crazy ex-girlfriend, complaining that Socrates doesn't make any advanced on him, and only wants to talk about philosophy. It was wild to witness Alcibiades like this, as my view of Alcibiades was shaped by Thucydides and Xenophon, who presented him as the villain most responsible for the downfall of the Athenian Empire. He was perhaps the most "Athenian" of Athens' generals, pushing Athens into taking more and more risks, ending with the Sicillian expedition. He then fled Athens to Sparta, then to Persia, then back to Athens again, showing no loyalty or morality. The events of the Symposium supposedly predated all of these events, and was an amazing insight into the psychology of Alcibiades.
