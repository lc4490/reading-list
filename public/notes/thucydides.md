#### General thoughts

Although on the surface, this text seems to just be a historical documentation of the Peloponnesian war between Athens and Sparta, I believe it is truly meant as a psychological study of the Athenian mind, how it will inevitably self-destruct, how it endangers its neighbors, and how it must ultimately be snuffed out for the good of the overall society.

#### Thoughts on Thucydides’ writing style

Thucydides’ writing style consists of long speeches, many of which he cannot have been present for. All Thucydides would have is the general broad strokes of what was said, so the detailed wording and specific sentiments must be his own commentary. On pages 73-77 of Rex Warner’s translation, Thucydides documents a speech given by the delegation of Corinth to Sparta, to air out its grievances towards Athens. Pages 75-76 specifically contain a detailed description of the Athenian psychology.

#### Thoughts on the Athenian pyschology

“The Athenian” as described in pages 75-76, is a concept we still recognize today, except now we call it Type A vs Type B personalities. Think Hamilton vs Burr in Hamilton. “The Athenian” is risk-taking and ambitious, always pushing beyond boundaries. “The Spartan”, on the other hand, is risk-averse, cautious, and content with stability. The dynamic of these two personalities co-existing is that “The Athenian” expands aggressively, outpacing its peers, and inevitably encroaches on its neighbors. In imperial terms, they pose a perpetual threat, driven to seek more greatness and territory until they overextend. Yet this drive that leads to greatness will also ultimately lead to collapse, when the risk is too great, and the empire collapses. That is the reason for the conflict: the Athenian mindset is a perpetual threat to itself and its neighbors, and must be destroyed for the wellbeing of those around it.

#### Thoughts on misinterpretation of Thucydides trap

Unfortuantely, Thucydides lasting legacy is not the amazing work and ideas he left for us in his writing, but “The Thucydides Trap”. “The Thucydides Trap” is the idea that war becomes increasingly likely when a rising power rises to threaten the existing power. In my opinion, this is an egregious misrepresentation of the reasons behind the conflict. Although it is true that the rise of Athens sparked fear in Sparta, it is not merely the fact that Athens was a rising power, but specifically the Atheninan mindset that struck fear in Sparta. It is not the rise of any power, it is the rise of Athenian power, the rise of a power that will endlessly expand and encroach on its surrounding until it implodes itself. The origin of the war lies in Athenian neighbors pleading for Spartan protection from the Athenian threat.

#### Thoughts on living in an Athenian victory

I believe the reason for the misinterpretation of Thucydides’ original ideas is the difference in mindset today vs the mindset of people in Thucydides’ time. It is not an exaggeration to say we live in an Athenian victory. The Athenian mindset is accepted, and even worshipped in today’s society. We laud ambitious, risk-taking individuals, and shun those who do not dream beyond themselves. Americans have normalized expansionist, imperial policies, so they can no longer recognize it as anything other than the norm. In Thucydides’ time, the Athenian mindset was novel, and seen as destructive to itself and those around it.

#### Thoughts on Athenian imperialism

After the first year of the Peloponnesian War, the leader of Athens, Pericles, gives a speech during the funeral for all the soldiers that died thus far in the war. He describes the greatness of Athenian democracy, its system of government and judicial system, all which is quite undeniable. I, myself, was entranced by the greatness of Athenian society, until the ending, when he declared that their city must be an education upon all of Greece. I believe I experienced a microcosm of the cognitive dissonance of Athenian life. Their society is undeniably great, and for these reasons, they feel the right to “educate” and spread their ideology across all of Greece. Such is the fallacy of hubris.

#### Thoughts on Athenian hypocrisy

Incredibly ironically, the very next chapter describes Athens’ hypocrisy. Despite all of Pericles grand claims about justice and how their system was vastly superior to the rest of Greece, when hit by plague, all of Athens resorted to lawlessness. This placement really highlights the hypocrisy of Athens, in one chapter boasting about its superiority and greatness, and the next chapter showing the reality.
