#### General Thoughts

I added this book to my reading list due to the common belief that Thucydides' narrative was incomplete, and Xenophon was the continuation. After finishing Thucydides, I disagree with this sentiment, believing that his narrative fulfilled its purpose. That left me a little lost with Xenophon, but I have enjoyed my reading experience thus far. I enjoyed Socrates' cameo, as my next text will feature him quite prominently.

#### Thoughts on Athenian government post-Sicillian expedition

The Athenian government and people seem to be spiraling further and further as they continue this war, and their losses mount up. Pericles speech in the first few years of the war described a proud and pious people. The following plague saw much of this sentiment evaporated, as the Athenians came face-to-face with desperation. The Mytilean debate further displayed this conflict and cognitive dissonance, as the Athenians debated whether or not to purge the entire Mytilean population after their capture of the city, with them eventually choosing not to. The Melian dialogue is the next step in this degradation of morality, as they decide to raze the entire city of Melos, who was not even involved in the conflict. Finally, as we near the end of the conflict and its eventual defeat, Athens overthrows its own democratic government, then overthrows its again, then starts killing its own generals for seemingly no reason. This history is comparable to The Joker in The Dark Knight, who believes society is filled with men who act moral only when times are good, but "when the chips are down, they'll eat each other". 4th century BC Athens is displaying this exact sentiment.

#### Thoughts on where Xenophon fits alongside Herodotus, Thucydides

I see Xenophon as the third installment in the trilogy of Greek historians, starting with Herodotus, leading into Thucydides, and concluding with Xenophon. This can be understood in multiple ways. First, it can be interpreted as the rise and fall of Ancient Greece or Hellas. The concept of pan-Hellenic identity was born in Herodotus' Histories, as a response to the Persian threat. Hellas tore itself apart in Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, as the Greek world was torn between Athens and Sparta. Xenophon captures the aftermath of this conflict, as the city states grow weak and decadent following the thirty year conflict, setting the stage for the Macedonian invasion. Another way of looking at it is the story of Athens, Herodotus sees the rise of Athens, Thucydides sees the fall of Athens, and Xenophon shows the aftermath. Whatever way you look at it, this text is heavily underrated and under-appreciated, and is a worthy final installment in the Ancient Greek Historical trilogy.
